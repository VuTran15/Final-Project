# Final-Project
The idea of this project is to create eight different kind of currencies and exchange one of them to another and vice versa.
We are sharing the same abstract class.
My first concrete class contains 
* Data Structure: I record and store the transaction history as a linked list.
* Loop and logical statements: have been used to convert from one currency to another currency. (If/else and switch/case)
* Exception handling: I used exception handling to catch all the exception would happen when taking the user's input.
* Class inheritance: My first concrete class implemented the abstract class, and my second concrete class extends interface class.
* Recursion: I used recursion to write the transaction into the file.
* Reading and Writing file: I write the transaction history from the linked list into the file, and use it to display the transaction history.
* GUI: I have a simple design for my code.
